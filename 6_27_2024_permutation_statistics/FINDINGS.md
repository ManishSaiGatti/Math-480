# Summary of findings.

## Statistic 1
**Accuracy achieved: 100.00%**

**Description of model weights: Return positive for 1 in last position, negative for no 1 in last position**

**How to compute statistic: For a given permuation, if the last number is a 1, then this stat is true.**


## Statistic 2
**Accuracy achieved: 100.00%**

**Description of model weights: Positive if second to last position is a 4 or 5 or if the last position is 1 or 2**
**Negative if second to last position is a 1 or 2 or if the last position is 4 or 5**

**How to compute statistic: If the second to last number is a 4 or 5 or if the last number is 1 or 2, this stat is true**
**However, there cannot be a 4 or 5 in the last digit or a 1 or 2 in the second to last digit**
